# DisplayDiagonal
Write a program in which you have to define a function displayDiagnol which will have two integer arguments named rows and cols. In the main function, take the values of rows and columns from the users. If the number of rows is same as numbers of columns then call the displayDiagnol function else show a message on screen that number of rows and columns is not same.
The following logic will be implemented inside the displayDiagnol function:
The function will take the value of rows and cols which are passed as argument and print the output in matrix form. To print the values in the matrix form, nested loops should be used.  For each loop, you have to use a counter variable as counter. When the value of counters for each loop equals, then it prints the value of row at that location and prints hard coded zero at any other location.

Example if the user enters rows and cols as 3, then the output should be like this
1 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 3
